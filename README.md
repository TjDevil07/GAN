# GAN - Generative Adversarial Neural Networks 

This project employs Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) using TensorFlow and Python. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, engaged in a competitive learning process. The aim is to create realistic data samples by training the generator to deceive the discriminator, enabling applications in image generation, data augmentation, and more.
